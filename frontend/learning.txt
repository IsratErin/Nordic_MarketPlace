Redux is a library for managing global application state.
In Redux : 
There is a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.
Dispatching actions is like "triggering an event" in the application and Reducers act like event listeners, 
and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.

##Redux's update pattern separates "what happened" from "how the state changes"
-Actions are plain objects with a type field, and describe "what happened" in the app
-Reducers are functions that calculate a new state value based on previous state + an action
-A Redux store runs the root reducer whenever an action is dispatched

##Redux uses a "one-way data flow" app structure
-State describes the condition of the app at a point in time, and UI renders based on that state
When something happens in the app:
-The UI dispatches an action
-The store runs the reducers, and the state is updated based on what occurred
-The store notifies the UI that the state has changed
-The UI re-renders based on the new state
